## Tasks

- Enrich data (can be done in the end, when we have processed all available data):
    - Add traffic data
    - Engineer new feature using data for national holidays. People travel with cars before and after holidays.
    - Add more weather data from different stations. And possibly inrepolate measurements for missing locations (e.g. we have temperature data for Druzhba and Lyulin and we interpolate the temperature for Sofia's center).

- Visualization:
    - Geographic data:
        - Visualize hotspots of PM10. Can we find special locations which contribute most for the PM10 pollution.
        - Visualize hotspots of meteorologic data. For example, there may be some locations with a lot of humidity or high pressure.
