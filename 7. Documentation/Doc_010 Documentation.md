Air pollution is one of the most serious problems in the world. It refers to the contamination of the atmosphere by harmful chemicals or biological materials. To solve the problem of air pollution, it's necessary to understand the issues and look for ways to counter it.

Air pollution can cause health effects in both short-term and long-term health effects.

Air pollution causes damage to crops, animals, forests, and bodies of water. It also contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from the sun's UV rays.
In Bulgaria, EEA collects air pollution statistics. It's important to study these statistics because they show how polluted the air has become in various places around the country.

In Sofia, air pollution norms were exceeded a lot of times in the past few years. The day with the worst air pollution in Sofia the norm was exceeded six times over. The two main reasons for the air pollution are believed to be solid fuel heating and motor vehicle traffic.

The main objectives are to predict the air pollution in Sofia for the next 24 hour period and to predict the chance of exceedance of 50 Âµg/m3 average for the day (EU air quality limit).
